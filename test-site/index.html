    <h3>Basic principles</h3>
    <p>
Sate is a minimum set of features built on top of a lightweight framework. Sate provides a developer-friendly CMS to drive a website. By using Javascript &amp; Node.js, it is highly portable, and modules can be written that function equally well as server-side pre-process directives and client-side dynamic widgets.

    <h3>Key Philosophies</h3>
    <p>Design decisions in Sate have been driven by the following underlying philosophies:</p>
    <div class="todo">Make this make more sense!</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Convention before Configuration - Unless something is genuinely unusual, there's no sense in making someone configure it... ship with intelligent defaults.</li>
        <li>Override instead of Declare - If a value at one level is the same as one level up, don't make me declare it again.</li>
        <li>Don't make me repeat myself - Default where possible, Template where necessary</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Directly edit markup, styles, &amp; script as if you were hand-coding a site</li>
        <li>"Template inversion" approach means individual pages have no "ceremony" necessary</li>
        <li>Automatic modern CMS facilities such as:
            <ul>
                <li>breadcrumb navigation</li>
                <li>digest pages</li>
                <li>image galleries</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Content backing agnostic:
            <ul>
                <li>first version to use SCM as a content store (no database)</li>
                <li>potential for Document (no-SQL) DB backing in future if desired</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Developer-friendly workflow:
            <ul>
                <li>run server in "Dev" mode for rapid iteration of site content (edit &amp; refresh)</li>
                <li>run server in "Live" mode for dynamic page serving (enabled dynamic behaviors)</li>
                <li>deploy entire site as static pages for high-performance</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
