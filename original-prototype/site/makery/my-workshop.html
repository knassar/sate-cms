    <p>Last summer, my wife and I bought our first home. One of our (my) requirements was a workshop, or at least the potential for a workshop. We're now many projects into the renovation of our home, but I wanted to share a teaser image of one of the rooms that I've spent a fair bit of time working on.</p>
    <p>We called it <em>"the cat pee room."</em> You can't tell from this "Before" picture, but it was physically difficult to spend more than a few moments in the room, as the carpet was saturated with... well... you know. I'm sure our agent thought we were nuts...</p>
    <p><img width="600" src="/images/stories/workshop/workshop_before.png" alt="workshop_before"></p>
    <p>Soon, I'll post some "After" pictures of my workshop—still a work in progress, but a major transformation nonetheless.</p>​
