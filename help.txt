Call Sate like this:

    node sate.js [directive] [flags]


Sate has four main directives:
    
    Directive       Explanation
   --------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------
    develop         Starts a stateless web-server which serves website page requests 
                    by re-evaluating all website sources on each request. This is 
                    useful when developing site content, as individual pages can be 
                    tested by reloading the browser page with each tweak.
                    If no directive is provided, 'develop' is assumed.

    run             Starts a web-server which serves website page requests. This 
                    differs from 'develop' in that the website sources are evaluated
                    only once at server-start time. The server must be restarted for
                    source changes to have any affect.
    
    deploy          Evaluates all website sources and generates the entire website as
                    static pages, for serving from Apache, Nginx, or other web server
                    Use this in production for highest performance.

    analyze         Evaluate all website sources just as 'run' or 'deploy' without 
                    producing any artifacts or server processes.
                    Returns a report on any fatal or non-fatal issues found, such as 
                    un-parseable config or missing page content.


Sate has a series of optional flags which can be combined with the directive to provide finer control over the directive:
    
    Flag                    Explanation
   ----------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------
    -w [path]               Provide a path to the website.json file.
    --website [path]        If not provided, looks for './website.json'

    -c [path]               Provide a path to the website content.
    --content [path]        If not provided, checks for 'siteConfig.content' in website.json, then assumes './content'

    -p [port number]        The port to listen on when running 'develop' or 'run' directive.
    --port [port number]    If not provided, checks for 'siteConfig.port' in website.json, then defaults to Sate.defaults.port

    -b [path]               Path to output deploy artifacts when running 'deploy'.
    --build-path [path]     If not provided, checks for 'siteConfig.buildPath' in website.json, then defaults to './build/.'

    --clean                 When running 'deploy', use this flag to tell Sate that it is
                            allowed to delete the contents of the build path

    -l [path]               Path to output logging when running 'run'.
    --log [path]            If not provided, checks for 'siteConfig.log' in website.json, then defaults to './log/.'

    -v                      Turns on 'verbose' logging.
    --verbose               If not provided, logging level is defined by 'siteConfig.logLevel' in website.json, then assumes normal logging.

    -q                      Turns on 'quiet' (minimal) logging.
    --quiet                 If not provided, logging level is defined by 'siteConfig.logLevel' in website.json, then assumes normal logging.

    -h                      Display help on how to use Sate
