    Command                 Explanation
   ----------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------
    help [command]          Show help for any command.
                            
    create                  Generate a prototype Sate website scaffold in the desired directory
    (alias: new)
                            
    update                  Update Sate plugins and support files in the target directory
                            
    develop                 Starts a stateless web-server which serves website page requests 
                            by re-evaluating all website sources on each request. This is 
                            useful when developing site content.
                            
    deploy                  Evaluates all website sources and generates the entire website as
    (alias: build)          static pages, for serving from Apache, Nginx, or other web server
                            Use this in production for highest performance.
                            
    analyze                 ** Unimplemented **
                            Evaluate all website sources just as 'run' or 'deploy' without 
                            producing any artifacts or server processes.
                            Returns a report on any fatal or non-fatal issues found, such as 
                            un-parseable config or missing page content.
                            
    docs                    Starts a web-server as with 'run' (on a different default port) which
                            serves the Sate CMS documentation site.
