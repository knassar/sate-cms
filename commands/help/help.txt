Call Sate like this:

    sate-cms [command] [flags]

Sate has the following commands:
    
    Command         Explanation
   --------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------
    help [command]  Show help for any command.

    create          Generate a prototype Sate website scaffold in the desired directory

    update          Update Sate plugins and support files in the target directory

    develop         Starts a stateless web-server which serves website page requests 
                    by re-evaluating all website sources on each request. This is 
                    useful when developing site content.

    run             Starts a web-server which serves website page requests. This 
                    differs from 'develop' in that the website sources are evaluated
                    only once at server-start time.
    
    deploy          Evaluates all website sources and generates the entire website as
                    static pages, for serving from Apache, Nginx, or other web server
                    Use this in production for highest performance.

    analyze         Evaluate all website sources just as 'run' or 'deploy' without 
                    producing any artifacts or server processes.
                    Returns a report on any fatal or non-fatal issues found, such as 
                    un-parseable config or missing page content.

    docs            Starts a web-server as with 'run' (on a different default port) which
                    serves the Sate CMS documentation site.


Each command has its own optional flags, but some flags are used across all commands:
    
    Flag                    Explanation
   ----------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------
    -h                      Show help
    --help
    
    -s [path]               Provide a path to the Sate website
    --site [path]           If not provided, assumes './'

    -l [path]               Path to output logging when running 'run'.
    --log [path]            If not provided, checks for 'siteConfig.log' in website.json, then defaults to './log/.'

    -v                      Turns on 'verbose' logging.
    --verbose               If not provided, logging level is defined by 'siteConfig.logLevel' in website.json, then assumes normal logging.

    -q                      Turns on 'quiet' (minimal) logging.
    --quiet                 If not provided, logging level is defined by 'siteConfig.logLevel' in website.json, then assumes normal logging.
