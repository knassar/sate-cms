    sate-cms develop [flags]

Starts a stateless web-server which serves website page requests 
by re-evaluating all website sources on each request. This is 
useful when developing site content, as individual pages can be 
tested by reloading the browser page with each tweak.
If no directive is provided, 'develop' is assumed.

Optional flags which can be combined with the develop command to provide finer control over the directive:
    
    Flag                    Explanation

    -p [port number]        The port to listen on when running 'develop' or 'run' directive.
    --port [port number]    If not provided, checks for 'siteConfig.port' in website.json, then defaults to Sate.defaults.port

    -l [path]               Path to output logging when running 'run'.
    --log [path]            If not provided, checks for 'siteConfig.log' in website.json, then defaults to './log/.'

    --verbose               If not provided, logging level is defined by 'siteConfig.logLevel' in website.json, then assumes normal logging.
