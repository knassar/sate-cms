    sate-cms develop [flags]

Starts a stateless web-server which serves website page requests by re-evaluating all website sources on each request. This is useful when developing site content, as individual pages can be tested by reloading the browser page with each tweak. 

If no command is provided, 'develop' is assumed.

Optional flags which can be combined with the develop command to provide finer control over the directive:
    
    Flag                    Explanation
   ----------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------
    -p [port number]        The port to listen on.
    --port [port number]    If not provided, checks for 'config.port' in website.json, then defaults to 3000

    -v                      Turns on 'verbose' logging.
    --verbose               If not provided, logging level is defined by 'config.logLevel' in website.json, then assumes normal logging.

    -q                      Turns on 'quiet' (minimal) logging.
    --quiet                 If not provided, logging level is defined by 'config.logLevel' in website.json, then assumes normal logging.
