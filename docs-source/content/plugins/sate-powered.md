    This plugin is included in the default HTML template. Feel free to remove it if you object on principle. If you want to use it in a different way, it's pretty simple to include. Just add the following to your page content or template:
</p>
<pre class="mustache">
    &#123&#123&#123plugin-sate-powered&#125&#125&#125
</pre>
<p>
    The result is the following markup which is pre-styled to match the Sate logo, and which links back to the Sate github site:
</p>
<div>
    {{{plugin-sate-powered}}}
</div>
    {{{plugin-sate-sequenceNav}}}
