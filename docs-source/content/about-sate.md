## Wherefore Sate?

Because I needed a new way to set up and update my various websites, because I wanted to do something fairly complicated in [node](http://nodejs.org) to keep my JavaScript chops up, and because I had an idea for a minimalist system that could replace and reduce my previous workflow.

Along the way, Sate has gotten more capable as I've accomodated additional features, but I'm very pleased with how little effort (and how little markup/code beyond the actual content) it takes to build quite a large and content-heavy website in Sate.

I'm sure that the sentence "But *`x`* can do that..." will be tossed about. My simple response to this is that I'd rather know a system inside and out because I built it and have it reflect my personal vision, than to spend a lot of time learning a system that reflects someone else's.
