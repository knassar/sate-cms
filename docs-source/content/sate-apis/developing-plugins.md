@intro:

Plugins are the primary way for developers to extend Sate's functionality. Indeed, as you've seen in the [Sate Documentation](/docs), most of the automatic navigation features of Sate are implemented as Plugins.

@content:

The Plugin API is fairly light-weight, but gives you hooks into the [Sate lifecycle][lifecycle] to implement very powerful features. In combination with the Sate, Website, and Page APIs, you can gain access to information throughout the website structure.

When writing a plugin, it is important to have a good understanding of the [Sate lifecycle][lifecycle] and the [Sate object types](/sate-apis/types) which will be required for the functionality you wish to create.
