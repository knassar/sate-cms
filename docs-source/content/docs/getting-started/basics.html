    Now that you've got a basic site up and running, you'll want to start making changes to make it your own site.

    The first thing to know is that the development web server started by the <code>develop</code> command automatically recompiles the entire site sources on each page request, so you don't need to restart Sate between changes. Just edit a source file and reload the page. To see this in action, lets make a few small changes to the stock Sate boilerplate.
</p>
<p>
    Open the <code>website.json</code> file in your favorite editor and take a look at it's structure. This file acts as the "manifest" for your Sate website. The <code>website.json</code> file contains all the site-wide configuration and maps the relationships between pages on your site.
</p>
<p>
    For now, find the value under the key <code>pageDefaults.title</code> and change the string "Your New Sate Site" to the name of your own website. Save the file, and reload the browser page. You should see the new page title show up as the page title. For example, in Chrome this is displayed in the browser tab for the page.
