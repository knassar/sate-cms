@intro:

Sate is a node.js application, so you'll need to have Node.js and NPM installed.

@content:

## System Requirements

Currently, Sate will run on any computer that is capable of running Node.js, **except Windows**.

### 1. Install Node.js & NPM

If you don't already have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed, you'll need it to run Sate. You can also install Node.js using various package managers like [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew).

You'll also need to install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org), the Node.js Package Manager.

[Isaac Schlueter](http://www.joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm/) has put together an excellent gist on [various ways to install Node and NPM](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814).

### 2. Install Sate

Once you have Node and NPM installed, installing Sate couldn't be easier:

<pre class="cli">
<div class="line"><span class="dir-prompt">~</span>npm install -g sate-cms</div>
</pre>
